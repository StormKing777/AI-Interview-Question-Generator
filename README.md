# 🚀 AI-Powered Interview Question Generator

A responsive web application designed to help software engineering candidates practice technical and behavioral interview questions. Built with a focus on core web fundamentals and high-performance logic.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** TypeScript (Logic Architecture) / JavaScript (Runtime)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Question Generation:** Utilizes a custom filtering algorithm to provide domain-specific questions (Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.) without page reloads.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.
* **Type-Safe Architecture:** Designed with TypeScript interfaces to ensure data integrity and scalable code structure.
* **Zero-Dependency Build:** Engineered using Vanilla web technologies to ensure instant load times and maximum browser compatibility.

## 📈 Engineering Highlights
